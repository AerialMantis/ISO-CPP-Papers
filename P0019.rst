Overview / Motivation / Discussion
******************************************************************

This paper proposes an extension to the atomic operations library [atomics]
for atomic operations applied to non-atomic objects.
As required by [atomics.types.generic] 20.5p1 the wrapped type **T**
must be trivially copiable.
This paper includes *atomic floating point* capability defined in P0020r5.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Motivation: Atomic Operations on a Single Non-atomic Object
---------------------------------------------------------------

An *atomic reference* is used to perform
atomic operations on referenced non-atomic object.
The intent is for *atomic reference* to provide the best-performing
implementation of atomic operations for the non-atomic object type.
All atomic operations performed through an *atomic reference*
on a referenced non-atomic object
are atomic with respect to any other *atomic reference* that references
the same object, as defined by equality of pointers to that object. 
The intent is for atomic operations
to directly update the referenced object.
The *atomic reference wrapping constructor* may acquire a resource,
such as a lock from a collection of address-sharded locks,
to perform atomic operations.
Such *atomic reference* objects are not lock-free and not address-free.
When such a resource is necessary subsequent
copy and move constructors and assignment operators
may reduce overhead by copying or moving the previously
acquired resource as opposed to re-acquiring that resource.

Introducing concurrency within legacy codes may require
replacing operations on existing non-atomic objects with atomic operations
such that the non-atomic object cannot be replaced with a **atomic** object.

An object may be heavily used non-atomically in well-defined phases
of an application.  Forcing such objects to be exclusively **atomic**
would incur an unnecessary performance penalty.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Motivation: Atomic Operations on Members of a Very Large Array
---------------------------------------------------------------

High performance computing (HPC) applications use very large arrays.
Computations with these arrays typically have distinct phases that
allocate and initialize members of the array,
update members of the array,
and read members of the array.
Parallel algorithms for initialization (e.g., zero fill)
have non-conflicting access when assigning member values.
Parallel algorithms for updates have conflicting access
to members which must be guarded by atomic operations.
Parallel algorithms with read-only access require best-performing
streaming read access, random read access, vectorization,
or other guaranteed non-conflicting HPC pattern.

An *atomic array reference* is used to perform
atomic operations on the non-atomic members of the referenced array.
The intent is for *atomic array reference* to provide the
best-performing implementation of atomic operations
for the members of the array.  

-----------------------------------------------------
Naming
-----------------------------------------------------

The current **Header <atomic> synopsis** contains the following.

  |  namespace std {
  |    template< class T > struct atomic;
  |    template< class T > struct atomic<T\*>;
  |  }

The proposal introduces the following type and partial specializations.

  |  namespace std {
  |  namespace experimental {
  |
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref;
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref<T\*>;
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref<T[]>;;
  |
  |  }}

Other possible naming or partial specializations

  - atomic_wrapper< T >,
    atomic_wrapper< T * >,
    atomic_wrapper< T[] >

  - atomic< T & >,
    atomic< T * & >,
    atomic< T[] >

---------------------------------------------------------------
*Wrappability* Constraints
---------------------------------------------------------------

The *wrapping constructor* of an atomic reference requires
that the object be *wrappable* for atomic operations;
for example that the object is properly aligned in memory
or resides in GPU register memory.
This revision of P0019 does not enumerate all potential
*wrappability* constraints or specify behavior of the
wrapping constructor when these constraints are violated.
It is quality-of-implementation to generate appropriate
error information.

Recommended feature text macro
-------------------------------------------

  | __cpp_lib_atomic_ref

-------------------------------------------
*add to* Header <atomic> synopsis
-------------------------------------------

  |  namespace std {
  |  namespace experimental {
  |
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref ;
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref< T \* >;
  |    template< class T > struct atomic_ref< T[] >;

*add section to* Class template atomic
-------------------------------------------

  |  template< class T > struct atomic_ref {
  |    using value_type = T;
  |    static constexpr size_t required_alignment = *implementation-defined* ;
  |    static constexpr bool is_always_lock_free = *implementation-defined* ;
  |    bool is_lock_free() const noexcept;
  |    void store( T , memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

  |    explicit atomic_ref( T & obj ); // *wrapping* constructor
  |
  |    T operator=(T) const noexcept ;
  |  };


**static constexpr size_t required_alignment =** *implementation-defined* **;**

  The required alignment of an object to be referenced by an atomic reference,
  which is at least ``alignof(T)``.
  [Note: An architecture may support lock-free atomic operations
  on objects of type *T* only if those objects meet a required
  alignment.  The intent is for *atomic_ref* to provide lock-free
  atomic operations whenever possible. 
  For example, an architecture may be able to support lock-free
  operations on ``std::complex<double>`` only if aligned to
  ``2*alignof(double)`` and not ``alignof(double)`` . - end note]


**atomic_ref( T & obj );**

  This wrapping constructor constructs an atomic reference
  that references the non-atomic object.
  Atomic operations applied to object through a referencing
  *atomic reference* are atomic with respect to atomic operations
  applied through any other *atomic reference* that references that *object*.

  *Requires:* The referenced non-atomic object shall be
  aligned to ``required_alignment``.
  The lifetime (3.8) of ``*this``
  shall not exceed the lifetime of the referenced non-atomic object.
  While any ``atomic_ref`` instance exists that references the object
  all accesses of that object shall exclusively occur through those
  ``atomic_ref`` instances.
  If the referenced *object* is of a class or aggregate type
  then members of that object shall not be concurrently
  wrapped by an ``atomic_ref`` object.
  The referenced object shall not be a member of an array that
  is wrapped by an ``atomic_ref<T[]>`` .
  [Note: Other implementation dependent conditions may exist. - end note]

  *Effects:* ``*this`` references the non-atomic object*
  [Note: The wrapping constructor may acquire a shared resource,
  such as a lock associated with the referenced object,
  to enable atomic operations applied to the referenced
  non-atomic object. - end note]

*add to* Partial specializations for elements of array of unknown bound
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performing compatibility verification within the atomic reference
wrapping constructor for many elements in an array can introduce
unecessary, redundant operations.
The *atomic array reference* partial specialization wraps the entire array
such that compatibility verification can be performed once and
amortized among all atomic references to members of that array.

  |  template< class T > struct atomic_ref< T[] > {
  |
  |    static constexpr size_t required_alignment = *implementation defined* ;
  |    static constexpr bool is_always_lock_free = *implementation defined* ;
  |    bool is_lock_free() const noexcept ;
  |
  |    atomic_ref() = delete ;
  |    atomic_ref( const atomic_ref & ) = delete ;
  |    atomic_ref & operator = ( const atomic_ref & ) = delete ;
  |
  |    atomic_array_ref( T * , size_t ); // wrapping constructor
  |
  |    size_t size() const noexcept ;
  |
  |    atomic_ref<T> operator[]( size_t ) const noexcept;
  |  };

**atomic_ref( T * array , size_t length );**

  This wrapping constructor constructs an ``atomic_ref<T[]>``
  that references an array of non-atomic elements
  spanning ``[array..array+length)``.

  *Requires:* The referenced non-atomic array shall be
  aligned to ``required_alignment``.
  The lifetime (3.8) of ``*this``
  shall not exceed the lifetime of the referenced non-atomic array.
  All ``atomic_ref<T[]>`` instances that reference any element of
  the array shall reference the same span of the array.
  As long as any ``atomic_ref<T[]>`` instance exists that references
  array all accesses to members of that array shall exclusively occur
  through those ``atomic_ref<T[]>`` instances.
  No element of array is concurrently wrap constructed by an
  ``atomic_ref<T>``.
  [Note: Other implementation dependent conditions may exist. - end note]

  *Effects:* ``*this`` references the non-atomic array.
  Atomic operations on members of array are atomic with respect
  to atomic operations on members referenced through any other
  ``atomic_ref<T[]>`` instance.
  [Note: The *wrapping constructor* may acquire shared resources,
  such as a locks associated with the referenced array,
  to enable atomic operations applied to the referenced
  non-atomic members of referenced array. - end note]

**atomic_ref<T> operator[]( size_t i ) const noexcept ;**

  *Requires:* ``i < size()`` and the lifetime of the returned
  ``atomic_ref<T>`` shall not exceed the lifetime of the
  associated ``atomic_ref<T[]>``.
  [Note: Analogous to the lifetime of an iterator with respect to the
  lifetime of the associated container. - end note]

  Example usage:

.. code-block:: c++

  // atomic reference wrapper constructor:
  atomic_ref<T[]> array( ptr , N );

  // atomic operation on a member:
  array[i].atomic-operation(...);

  // atomic operations through a temporary value 
  // within a concurrent function:
  auto x = array[i];
  x.atomic-operation-a(...);
  x.atomic-operation-b(...);

..
